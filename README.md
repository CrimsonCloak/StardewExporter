# Purpose 

This repository contains the code and related files for writing a Prometheus exporter in Python that analyses a targeted Stardew Valley save folder. The goal of this project is mostly for learning how to read XML files, use Python to write a Prometheus exporter for them, creating your own metrics of the data and eventually visualising using another software of your choice.

# Limitations

The exporter is only applied on a static save file, so there is no real-time data updates as you play the game. The data only gets updated whenever you manually save your game (VERIFY).
